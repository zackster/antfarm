	<div class="distortion">
	<label class="distortion">Assuming</label>
	<span class="distortion">Assuming the worst without testing the evidence.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Shoulds (Musts/Oughts)</label>
	<span class="distortion">Demands we make of ourselves. If we really knew better or could have done better, then we <i>would have done better</i>. Instead, we can replaces "shoulds" with "woulds" or "coulds".</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">The Fairty-Tale Fantasy</label>
	<span class="distortion">Demanding the ideal from life. It <i>would</i> be nice if things were ideal, but they're not. Too bad. Now, I wonder what I <i>could</i> do to improve things.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">All or Nothing Thinking</label>
	<span class="distortion">Performing below some standard usually means we've performed at 80 percent or at 35 percent - rarely at 0 percent. And poor <i>performance</i> never makes a complex <i>person</i> worthless, just fallible.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Overgeneralizing</label>
	<span class="distortion">Deciding that negative experiences describe your life completely. Such global statements are unkind, depressing, and usually inaccurate to some degree. The antidote is to use more precise language.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Labeling</label>
	<span class="distortion">Giving yourself a label, or name, as though a single word describes a person completely. Confine labels to behaviors rather than people.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Dwelling on the Negative</label>	
	<span class="distortion">Focusing on the negative aspects of a situation instead of putting it into perspective, alongside other positives.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Rejecting the Positive</label>
	<span class="distortion">Negating positive so that our self-esteem remains low. If someone compliments your work, you dismiss it by saying "Oh, it was really nothing." Failing to give yourself credit where it is due. Often coupled with criticizing yourself when things go wrong.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Unfavorable Comparisons</label>
	<span class="distortion">Often occurs when magnifying another's strengths while minimizing another's faults and your own accomplishments. Ask yourself: "Why must I compare? Why can't I just appreciate that each person has unique strengths and weaknesses? Another's contributions aren't necessarily better, just different."</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Catastrophizing</label>
	<span class="distortion">When you believe something is a catastrophe, you tell yourself that it is so awful that you "can't stand it!" This convinces yourself that you are too feeble to cope with life. Even in the worst-case scenario, you are still alive. You can "stand" anything, short of being steamrolled to death.</span>
	
	<label class="distortion">Personalizing</label>
	<span class="distortion">Personalizing is seeing yourself more involved in negative events than you really are. Distinguish influences from causes, and look realistically for other influences outside of ourselves. The ego becomes so involved that each event becomes a test of worth.</span>
		
	<label class="distortion">Blaming</label>
	<span class="distortion">Blaming is the opposite of personalizing. Whereas personalizing puts responsibility on yourself for your difficulties, blaming puts it all on something outside of yourself. The problem with blaming is that it tends to make us think of ourselves as helpless victims who are too powerless to cope. You can still assume realistic responsibility, but instead you can take responsibility for behavior or a choice, not for being bad to the core.</span>
		
	<label class="distortion">Making Feelings Facts</label>
	<span class="distortion">This happens when you take your feelings as proof of the way that things are. Feelings result from our thoughts, distorted thoughts may not reflect reality. Ask yourself: what would someone who is 100 percent inadqueate, bad, guilty, or hopeless be like? Am I really like that?</span>
